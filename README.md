Workshop 9: Live Video
•	Make an experimental 'smart mirror' using live video capture.
•	Include manipulations at the level of the pixel.
•	Make a new repository for your p5.js project on your GitHub account, publish your sketch as a webpage, and include a README file in your repository with a URL to the webpage along with documentation of your work.

##Process
Beginning by reviewing the workshop, and Daniel Shiffman’s covering of the same topic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNqaw8LT2ZU&t=717s) I began by mainly following the workshop until I reached a point of feedback, pixel loading and scaling, before taking on elements of Shiffman’s code until I reached the basic point of Shiffman’s pixelated video feedback. The code, whilst original, was strongly based on his at this point, and after was completely original.

Adapting the pixel loop to display semi transparent ellipses which overlapped, I then attempted to integrate a constructor, with the aims of animating them, and eventually integrating colour values from their x/y coordinates. This was abandoned later due to being too close to the demonstration, and also the difficulty of integrating already half broken code into half broken code.

Shifting through variables and making alterations to it, I adapted the brightness/size link into the circular overlap, creating the 3d effect in the final
